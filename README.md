# Ising Network Model in Python

The Ising network model is a type of undirected graphical model that belongs to the Markov Random Field. The Ising network model is closely related to psychometrics network models for modeling psychological traits. It is also widely used in diverse areas to model binary features from a graphical approach. However, despite its versatile application, there is no developed package in Python for the Ising network model. In this project, I developed a Python class for learning the Ising network model. This unsupervised learning algorithm estimates an Ising network model from data with binary features (1 or -1).
